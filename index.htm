This once in a lifetime trail on ice over the frozen Zanskar river has emerged as a must do trek for all avid adventurers. The route traversing altitudes of nothing less than 14,000ft / 4500 metres, goes over the frozen Zanskar river traversing deep canyons and gorges otherwise inaccessible during the summer months. And, under the solemn gaze of greyish - white mountain peaks temperatures can plummet to –anywhere between -25 to -30º c. Our halting stages for camping at night are often caves in the hillsides. The altitudes we traverse are all above 4500 metres / 14,000 feet. This is still a traditional winter route used by the Zanskari folk to travel to Leh with no other options.</p>
